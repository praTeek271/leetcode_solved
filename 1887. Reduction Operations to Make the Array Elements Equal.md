# Code for  '1887. Reduction Operations to Make the Array Elements Equal' (JAVA) 

```
class Solution {
  public int reductionOperations(int[] nums) {
    int ans = 0;

    Arrays.sort(nums);

    for (int i = nums.length - 1; i > 0; --i)
      if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1])
        ans += nums.length - i;

    return ans;
  }
}
```

# Intuition
The intuition behind this solution is to leverage the fact that the array needs to be reduced to a uniform value, and we can only increment elements, excluding the largest one. Sorting the array allows us to identify distinct elements efficiently and calculate the number of operations needed.

# Approach
1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting the array in ascending order helps in identifying distinct elements efficiently.

2. **Counting Operations**: Iterate through the sorted array from the end to the second element. For each distinct element encountered, accumulate the number of operations needed to make it equal to the largest element (located at the end of the array).

3. **Return Result**: The accumulated count represents the total number of operations required to make all elements in the array equal.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n \log n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the input array. This complexity arises from the sorting step.
  
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size. The sorting is done in-place, and the additional variables used are independent of the input size.
