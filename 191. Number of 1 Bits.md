# Code for '191. Number of 1 Bits ' (Python) 

### Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

    Example 1:
    
    Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.



```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        c = 0
        

        while n != 0:
            n &= (n - 1)
            c += 1
        return c
```
